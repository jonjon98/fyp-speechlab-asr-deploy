Ensure nginx ingress controller is up. 
If it is not, use `[pathTo "deployment-on-prem.sh"] ingress-controller up`.

Check /etc/host to ensure that `172.26.0.5 asr-project.com` is in. 
If not, add it in.

Use `python3 [pathTo "client3.py"] -u ws://asr-project.com:80/client/ws/speech -m "[language]" [pathToAudioFile]` to start transcribing.
